Data Analysis on AI-Generated random data T-T

IMPORTANT: (Run all of the files on google colab or delete the google colab specific code while running on your platform of choice)

This repo is filled with data analysis programs where I use the most popular datasets for training and test it on test data generated by ChatGPT.
The basic .csv files are the training datasets and the ones which have test in the name of the file are the ones which are generated by ChatGPT.

Is it a good idea?

You'll find out XD
